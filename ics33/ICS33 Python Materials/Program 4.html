This programming assignment is designed to show how we can get Python to check
  function annotations whenever annotated functions are called.
For each of Python's built-in data types, we will develop an interpretation
  (and write code to check that interpretation) of how the data type specifies
  type information that is checkable when a function is called.
<p>

For example, we specified the main <b>dict</b> for the NDFA in Programming
  Assignment #1 by the notation
<b></b></p><pre><b>  dict[str]-&gt;(dict[str]-&gt;set[str])</b></pre>
Recall the outer-<b>dict</b> associates a <b>str state</b> key with a value
  that is an inner-<b>dict</b>; and the inner-<b>dict</b> associates a 
 <b>str transition</b> with a value that is a set of <b>str states</b>.
In our annotation checker, we will use an alternative notation to specify this
  type information equivalently and compactly:
<b><pre>  {str : {str : {str}}}</pre></b>
Note that this is an actual data structure in Python, where <b>str</b> is
  a reference to the string class object.
It is an outer-<b>dict</b> whose single key is <b>str</b> and whose associated
  value is an inner-<b>dict</b> whose single key is a <b>str</b> and whose
  value is a <b>set</b> that contains just element, <b>str</b>.
<p>

We will write the <b>Check_Annotation</b> class and use it as a decorator for
  functions whose annotations we want to check each time the function is called.
Internally it will overload the <b>__call__</b> method to call the function only
  after checking its annotation by using mutual recursion (not direct
  recursion), in a natural way, to process the nesting of data types inside
  data types illustrated in the notation above.
We will write code that ensures that this checking works for the standard
  classes defined in Python.
The code will also know how to process a special annotation-checking protocol
  (via the <b>__check_annotation__</b> method) that we can implement in any
  new classes that we write, so that that class can become part of the
  annotation language (I have done this for two classes; you can do it for the
  <b>Bag</b> class for extra credit).
</p><p>

I suggest that you look at the code in the modules that appear in the project
  folder that you will download.
Then (see the detailed instructions in this document) we can add/test/debug
  capabilities for each of the built-in data types we can use in the annotation
  language, iteratively enhancing our code until we can use all the built-in
  data types in annotations.
Once we do this for <b>list</b> (about a dozen lines; the biggest of my
  checking functions), all the others are variants and therefore much easier to
  write (but still with some interesting details).
</p><p>

Download the 
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Epattis/ICS-33/assignments/program4/program4.zip">program4</a> project folder and use it to create an
  Eclipse project.
We can test our class (put it in the <b>checkannotation.py</b> module, which
  already includes some useful code) at the end of the class itself, or in a
  special driver that is included, which uses a batch file to test progressively
  more and more complex data types in the annotation language.
</p><p>

It is recommend that you work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in your
  lab section.
Try to find someone who lives near you, with similar programming skills,
  and work habits/schedule: e.g., talk about whether you prefer to work
  mornings, nights, or weekends; what kind of commitment you will make to submit
  program early.
<!---
If you believe that it is impossible for you to work with someone, because of
  some special reason(s), you should send me email stating them and asking for
  special permission to work alone (which I do grant, but not frequently).
--->
</p><p>

<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
</p><pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
<p>
If you do not know what the terms cooperatively and/or rules for pair
  programming mean, please read about Pair Programming before starting this
  assignment.
</p><p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
The code you write should be as compact and elegant as possible, using 
  appropriate Python idioms.

<td width="20%"><b>Problem #1: Check_Annotation</b></td>
<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write a class named <b>Check_Annotation</b> that decorates a function, such
  that when the decorated function is called, the decorator class check's the
  decorated function's annotation, using the annotation language described
  below in detail.
We can use this decorator by writing either
<b><pre>  def f(params-annotation) -&gt; result-annotation:
      ...
  f = Check_Annotation(f)</pre></b>
or
<b><pre>  @Check_Annotation
  def f(params-annotation) -&gt; result-annotation:
      ...</pre></b>
which is a special Python syntactic form that expands to the former assignment.
Thus, when the decorated <b>f</b> is called, Python calls
  <b>Check_Annotations.__call__</b> in the decorator, which first checks the
  annotations (and raises an exception if it is not met) and second
  computes/returns the decorated function <b>f</b>: the original one written.
<p>
This class defines four major attributes:
</p><ul>
<li>the <b>checking_on</b> instance name to turn off/on annotation checking in
      all decorated functions; it starts on.
<p>

</p></li><li>the <b>__init__</b> method to remember the function being decorated and
      initialize a per-function name that helps controls annotation checking;
      it also starts on: for a function call to check its annotation, both
      <b>checking_on</b> and its per-function name must be <b>True</b>: if
      either is <b>False</b> the annotation is not checked.
<p>

</p></li><li>the <b>__call__</b> method that intercepts each call to the decorated
      function and decides whether to check the annotation, and if so
      implements annotation checking, both for parameters and returned results,
      if they are specified; if annotation checking succeeds, this method
      computes/returns the result of calling the decorated function.
<p>

</p></li><li>the <b>check</b> method (specified in more detail below) that does the
       annotation checking: it either succeeds silently or raises an
       <b>AssertionError</b> exception with useful information specified
       in the details below.
    Note that the unconditional assertion,
      <b><pre>  assert False, message</pre></b>
      is a simple way to raise <b>AssertionError</b> with a message.
    I wrote many nested helper functions in <b>check</b>, one for each
      data type annotation that can be checked: e.g., <b>check_dict</b>.
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><h3>Details</h3>

Let's explore the meaning of the <b>__call__</b> and <b>check</b> methods in 
  more detail.
<ol type="I">
<li>
The <b>__call__</b> method intercepts calls to the decorated function;
  it specifies <b>*args</b> and <b>**kargs</b> to handle all calls,
  regardless of their parameter structure.
My method was about 40 lines (but about 17 lines were comments/blank, and
  7 comprise the <b>param_arg_binding</b> local function supplied in the
  download; this function computes an <b>ordereddict</b> of the parameter
  names (each associated to its argument) in the order that the parameters
  are defined in the function.
The <b>__call__</b> method
<ul>
<li>determines whether to check the annotations (see above); if not just
       call the decorated function and return its result.
<p>
</p></li><li>determines the parameters of the function and the matching arguments
      they are bound to.
    The <b>param_arg_bindings</b> function (written locally in this method)
       returns an ordered dictionary of parameter/value bindings; ordered means
       that when iterated, keys always appear in the same order: the order the
       parameters appear in in the function's definition.
    It uses the various attributes in the <b>inspect</b> module to do the job.
    You might be interested in reading the documentation for the <b>inspect</b>
      module: it is quite interesting and many of its (powerful) features are
      new to Python.
<p>
</p></li><li>determines the annotations of the parameters by using the
      <b>__annotations__</b> attribute of any function object.
    This name is bound to a dictionary containing as keys every annotated
      parameter name; the associated value for each parameter name is its
      annotation.
    If we defined the function <b>f</b> using
       <b>def f(x:int,y,z:int):-&gt;str...</b> its <b>__annotations__</b>
      dictionary is
<b><pre>{'x': &lt;class 'int'&gt;, 'z': &lt;class 'int'&gt;, 'return': &lt;class 'str'&gt;&gt;}</pre></b>
Notice that parameter <b>y</b> has no annotation so it does not appear as a key
  in this dictionary, and the key <b>return</b> is associated with the
  annotation for the returned value (after the <b>-&gt;</b>).
<p>

</p></li><li>If any checked annotations (parameters or returned result) raise the
      <b>AssertionError</b> handle it by printing the relevant source lines
      for the function (see the <b>getsourcelines</b> function in the 
      <b>inspect</b> module's documentation) and reraise the exception,
      skipping the rest of the code in this method.
  <ul>
  <li>Checks every parameter that has an annotation
  <p>
  </p></li><li>Call the decorated function to compute its returned result (and save it).
  <p>
  </p></li><li>If <b>'return'</b> is in the dictionary of annotions:
     (a) add the result as the value associated with the key <b>_return</b> in
          the dictionary of parameter and argument bindings; (b) check the
          annotation for <b>return</b>
  <p>
  </p></li><li>Return the result.    
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>

</p></li><li>
The <b>check</b> method has the following header
<b><pre>  def check(self,param,annot,value,check_history=''):</pre></b>
where
<ul>
<li><b>self</b>  is an instance of the <b>Check_Annotation</b> class
</li><li><b>param</b> is a string that specifies the name of the parameter being
        checked (or <b>'_return'</b> for checking the returned value)
</li><li><b>annot</b> is a data structure that specifies the annotation
</li><li><b>value</b> is the value of <b>param</b> that the annotation should be
        checked against (to ensure it is legal)
</li><li><b>check_history</b> is a string that embodies the history of checking the
       annotation for the parameter to here (it is extended by concatenation in
       each recursive call to provide context for any annotation violations to
       be checked later); it is printed after the details of any annotation
       violation, to suppy context for the failure.
</li></ul>
<p>

Each call to <b>check</b> decodes the <b>annot</b> to check, and checks it
  against the <b>value</b>: <b>check</b>'s body is one big
    <b>if/elif/.../else</b> determining which local function to call to check
    the specific annotation (and letting that local function do the real work).
Most annotations are checked by calling a function defined locally in
  <b>check</b> that can use the parameters of <b>check</b> freely, because
  these functions are defined in <b>check</b>'s local scope (in fact these local
  functions are often parameterless: many get all the information they need
  from check's parameters).
The more complicated local functions also call <b>check</b>; so <b>check</b>
  calls a local function which can call <b>check</b>: this is indirect
  recursion.
My method was about 100 lines: about 13 lines were comments/blank, and 60 more
  appeared in 5 locally declared functions -including one to solve the extra
  credit part of this assignment- so I had about a dozen lines per local
  function.
</p><p>

The annotation checking language comprises the following components
  (for Python's built-in types).
I <b>strongly</b> suggest writing/testing each component before moving on to
  the next: all are similar and understanding/testing/debugging <b>list</b>
  (the first really interesting one) will supply tremendous insight for writing
  all.
<b>Write the required exception messages exactly to match the ones shown.</b>

</p><ul>
<li><b>annot</b> is <b>None</b>: do nothing (succeed silently).
    note that <b>def f(x):</b> has no annotation to check for its parameter
    <b>x</b>, but <b>def f(x:None):</b> has an annotation to check for <b>x</b>,
    but it never fails.
    <b>None</b> has more interesting uses inside more complicated data types,
      illustrated below (see the last example for <b>list</b>).
<p>

</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is any <b>type</b> (e.g., <b>type(annot) is type)</b>:
    fail if <b>value</b> is not an instance of the specified type, with an
       exception messages matching the following examples.
    The <b>isinstance</b> function (covered in the inheritance lectures)
       generalizes checking the type of an object.
    Instead of writing <b>type(x) is someclass</b> we write
       <b>isinstance(x,someclass)</b>: it checks whether <b>x</b>'s object is
       constructed from <b>someclass</b> or any base class of
       <b>someclass</b>, which is the correct test to perform here.
<p>

For <b>def f(x:int):...</b> called as <b>f('abc')</b> or <b>f(x='abc')</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b></b></p><pre><b>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 'abc'
  was type str ...should be type int</b></pre>
For <b>def f(x:list):...</b> called as <b>f({1,2})</b>
 the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = {1, 2}
  was type set ...should be type list</pre></b>
<p>
All exception messages described in the sections below follow this same general
  format, although the more complicated ones supply extra context via the
  <b>check_history</b> parameter.

</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is a <b>list</b> (not the <b>list</b> class object, but an
        instance of <b>list</b>: a real list of one or more values; see the
       examples below) where each element in <b>list</b> is an annotation.
    Fail if
    <ol>
    <li><b>value</b> is not a list
    </li><li><b>annot</b> has just one element-annotation, and any of the elements in
           the <b>value</b> list fails the element-annotation check
    </li><li><b>annot</b> has more than one element-annotation, and
        <ol type="a">
          <li>the <b>annot</b> and <b>value</b> lists have a different number
               of elements, or
          </li><li>any element in the <b>value</b> list fails its corresponding
               element-annotation check
        </li></ol>
    </li></ol>
<p>

Here are some examples of failures:
</p><ol>
<li>For <b>def f(x:[int]):...</b> called as <b>f({1,2})</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = {1, 2}
  was type set ...should be type list</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:[int]):...</b> called as <b>f([1,'a'])</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 'a'
  was type str ...should be type int
list[1] check: &lt;class 'int'&gt;</pre></b>
Note that when each element in the list is tested, it appends the index it is
  checking and the annotation it is checking to the <b>check_history</b>
  (which prints after the actual annotation that fails: here the line starting
  <b>list[1] check: ...</b>): it means the element at index <b>0</b> did not
  fail this annotation but the element at index <b>1</b> did.
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:[int,str]):...</b> called as <b>f([1])</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong number of elements): value = [1]
  annotation had 2 elements[&lt;class 'int'&gt;, &lt;class 'str'&gt;]</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:[int,str]):...</b> called as <b>f([1,2])</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 2
  was type int ...should be type str
list[1] check: &lt;class 'str'&gt;</pre></b>
</li></ol>
<p>

Note that the annotation <b>def f(x:list):...</b> and the annotation 
  <b>def f(x:[None]):...</b> have the same meaning (but the former is faster to
  check): the first checks only that <b>x</b> is an instance of <b>list</b>;
  the second checks that <b>x</b> is an instance of <b>list</b> and then checks
  each of its values agains the annotation <b>None</b>, which according to that
  rule's annotation does not checking and never fails -so really the checks are
  the same.
</p><p>
Likewise note that for <b>def f(x:[int,None]):...</b> called as
  <b>f([1,'a'])</b> no exception is raised, because the annotation for the list
  element at index <b>1</b> is <b>None</b>, which according to that rule's
  annotation does no checking of the list's value at index <b>1</b> and never
  fails.
</p><p>

Note also that for <b>def f(x:[[str]]):...</b> called as
  <b>f([['a','b'],['c','d']])</b> no exception is raised, because the annotation
  says <b>x</b> is a list containing lists that contain only strings.
The code to check list annotations will indirectly call itself (recursively) in
  the process of checking this annotation.
Think about this now, when there are few data types being processed; it will be
  natural to perform other recursive annotation checks in the <b>check</b>
  method.
In fact, spend a good amount of time simplifying the local function that
  performs this check, because most of the other annotations listed below look
  very similar.
</p><p>

Finally, note if we called <b>f([['a',1],['c','d']])</b> the exception message
  would be
</p><pre><b>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 1
  was type int ...should be type str
list[0] check: [&lt;class 'str'&gt;]
list[1] check: &lt;class 'str'&gt;</b></pre>
which indicates that the annotation of <b>list[0]</b> was being checked when the
  annotation for <b>list[1]</b> was being checked (each of its values should be
  a <b>list</b> of <b>str</b>), when Python found a non-string that violated
  the annotation.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is a <b>tuple</b> (not the <b>tuple</b> class object, but an
        instance of <b>tuple</b>: a real tuple of values), where each element
        in <b>annot</b> is an annotation.
<p>

Structurally, checking tuples is equivalent to checking lists (all 3 rules
   apply).
In fact, I parameterized the local function that I originally wrote for checking
  lists to work for checking tuples as well).
Of course, the error messages should use the word <b>list</b> and <b>tuple</b>
  where appropriate.
<b>Caution</b>: remember for tuples of one value we must write
     f(x:(int,)):...; notice the comma after <b>int</b>.
</p><p>

</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is a <b>dict</b> (not the <b>dict</b> class object, but an
        instance of <b>dict</b>: a real dictonary; see the examples below),
        with exactly one key: both the key and its associated value are each
        an annotation.
    Note, this annotation should work for subclases of <b>dict</b>, e.g.,
       <b>defaultdict</b>.
    Check it not by <b>type(annot) is dict</b> but using the <b>isinstance</b>
       function (covered in the inheritance lectures):
       <b>isinstance(annot,dict)</b>
    Fail if
    <ol>
    <li><b>value</b> is not a <b>dict</b> or a subclass of <b>dict</b>
    </li><li><b>annot</b> has more than one key/value association: this is actually
           a bad/illegal annotation, not a failed annotation
    </li><li><b>annot</b> has one key/value association, and
           <ol type="a">
              <li> any key in the <b>value</b> dictionary fails the
                     key-annotation check or
              </li><li>any value in the <b>value</b> dictionary fails the
                     value-annotation check
           </li></ol>
    </li></ol>
<p>

Here are some examples of failures:
</p><ol>
<li>For <b>def f(x:{str : int}):...</b> called as <b>f(['a',0])</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = ['a', 0]
  was type list ...should be type dict</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:{str : int, int : int}):...</b> called as <b>f({'a':0})</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' annotation inconsistency: dict should have 1 item but had 2
  annotation = {&lt;class 'str'&gt;: &lt;class 'int'&gt;, &lt;class 'int'&gt;: &lt;class 'int'&gt;}</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:{str : int}):...</b> called as <b>f({1:0})</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 1
  was type int ...should be type str
dict key check: &lt;class 'str'&gt;</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:{str : int}):...</b> called as <b>f({'a':'b'})</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 'b'
  was type str ...should be type int
dict value check: &lt;class 'int'&gt;</pre></b>
</li></ol>  
Of course, if a dictionary had many keys, it would check the required
  annotations for each of its keys and their associated values.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is a <b>set</b> (not the <b>set</b> class object, but an
        instance of <b>set</b>: a real set of values; see the examples below)
        where its has exactly one value that is an annotation.
    Fail if
    <ol>
    <li><b>value</b> is not a <b>set</b>
    </li><li><b>annot</b> has more than one value: this is actually
           a bad/illegal annotation, not a failed annotation
    </li><li><b>annot</b> has one value, and any value in the <b>value</b> set
           fails the value-annotation check
    </li></ol>
<p>

Here are some examples of failures:
  
</p><ol>
<li>For <b>def f(x:{str}):...</b> called as <b>f(['a','b'])</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = ['a', 'b']
  was type list ...should be type set</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:{str,int}):...</b> called as <b>f({'a',1})</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' annotation inconsistency: set should have 1 value but had 2
  annotation = {&lt;class 'str'&gt;, &lt;class 'int'&gt;}</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:{str}):...</b> called as <b>f({'a',1})</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 1
  was type int ...should be type str
set value check: &lt;class 'str'&gt;</pre></b>
</li></ol>  
<p>
</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is a <b>frozenset</b> (not the <b>frozenset</b> class object,
        but an instance of <b>frozenset</b>: a real frozenset of values) where
        its one value is an annotation.
<p>

Structurally, checking frozensets are equivalent to checking sets (all 3 rules
   apply).
In fact, I parameterized the local function that I originally wrote for checking
  sets to work for checking frozensets as well, similarly to the general
  function I wrote for checking lists/tuple.
Of course, the error messages should use the word <b>set</b> and
  <b>frozenset</b> where appropriate.
</p><p>

</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is a <b>lambda</b> (or any function object) that is a
      predicate with one parameter and returning a value that can be
      interpreted as a <b>bool</b>.
    Fail if
    <ol>
    <li><b>annot</b> has zero/more than one parameters: this is actually
           a bad/illegal annotation, not a failed annotation
    </li><li>Calling the lambda/function on <b>value</b> returns <b>False</b>
    </li><li>Calling the lambda/function on <b>value</b> raises an exception
    </li></ol>
<p>

Note that we can recognize a function/lambda object by calling the
   <b>inspect</b> module's <b>isfunction</b> predicate; we can determine the
   number of parameters in a function/lambda object by accessing its
   <b>__code__.co_varnames</b> attribute.
You might be interested in reading the documentation for the <b>inspect</b>
  module: it is quite interesting and many of its (powerful) features are new
  to Python.
</p><p>

Here are some examples of failures:  in the first two, the argument fails the
  <b>lambda</b> directly; in the others the argument is a list on which the
  <b>lambda</b> is checked for every value and fails for one.

</p><ol>
<li>For <b>def f(x:lambda x,y : x&gt;0):...</b> called as <b>f(1)</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' annotation inconsistency: predicate should have 1 parameter but had 2

<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:lambda x : x&gt;0):...</b> called as <b>f(0)</b>

<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:[lambda x : x&gt;0]):...</b> called as <b>f([1,0])</b>

Note that in this example we are checking the <b>lambda</b> annotation for

Note that for <b>def f(x:[lambda x : isinstance(x,int) and x&gt;0]):...</b> called as

</li></ol>
<p>

</p></li><li><b>annot</b> is not any of the above (or <str>, specified in the extra
    credit part below).
    Assume it is an object constructed from a class that supports annotation
      checking, by that class defining the the <b>__check_annotation__</b>
      method.
    Fail if
    <ol>
    <li>There is no <b>__check_annotation__</b> method in the class: e.g., 
          calling the <b>__check_annotation__</b> method raises the
          <b>AttributeError</b> exception (the object was not constructed from a
          class that supports the annotation checking protocol): this is

    </li></ol>
<p>

Note that I have written the <b>Check_All_OK</b> and <b>Check_Any_OK</b>
  classes that support the annotation checking protocol; check them out.
</p><p>
Here are some examples of failures.
The first assumes the <b>Bag</b> class does not support the annotation
  checking protocol; the second assumes it does; the third assumes it supports
  the protocol but raises some other exception (not <b>AssertionError</b>).
</p><ol>
<li>For <b>def f(x:Bag([str])):...</b> called as <b>f(Bag('a'))</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' annotation undecipherable: Bag(&lt;class 'str'&gt;[1])</pre></b>
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:Bag([str])):...</b> called as <b>f(Bag(['a',1]))</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 1

<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:Bag([lambda x : x &gt; 0)):...</b> called as

<p>

The <b>checkannotation.py</b> module defines the <b>Check_All_OK</b> and
  <b>Check_Any_OK</b> classes, which implement the check annotation protocol.
Note that with the <b>Check_Any_OK</b> class, we can specify that every value in
  a list must contain a string or integer.
So for <b>def f(x:[Check_Any_OK(str,int)]):...</b> called as
  <b>f(['a',1])</b> there is no exception raised.
Likewise with the <b>Check_All_OK</b> class, we can specify that every value in
  a list must be an integer and must be bigger than 0.
So for <b>def f(x:[Check_All_OK(int,lambda x : x &gt; 0)]:...</b> called as
  <b>f([1,2])</b> there is no exception raised.
</p></li></ol>
</str></li></ul>

<b>Extra credit</b>:
Implement the following annotations as well.
<ul>
<li><b>annot</b> is a <b>str</b> object, which when <b>eval</b>uated using a 
      dictionary in which all the parameters are defined (and the returned 
      result is the value of the key <b>'_return'</b>) returns a value that can
      be interpreted as a <b>bool</b>.
    This specifiction is similar to lambdas/functions, but more general, because
      the expressions can name multiple names, not just the parameter.
       Fail if
    <ol>
    <li>Evaluating the string returns <b>False</b>
    </li><li>Evaluating the string raises an exception
    </li></ol>
<p>

Here are some examples of failures.
</p><ol>
<li>For <b>def f(x,y:'y&gt;x'):...</b> called as <b>f(0,0)</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'y' failed annotation check(str predicate: 'y&gt;x')
  args for evaluation: x-&gt;0, y-&gt;0</pre></b>
Notice that with this form of annotation, we can check properties that depend on
  values of multiple parameters (not just type information).
The values of all the parameters are included in the error message.
Likewise we can check properties that depend on the returned values.
For <b>def f(x,y)-&gt;'_result &lt; x or _return &lt; y': return x + y</b> called as
  <b>f(3, 5)</b> the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'return' failed annotation check(str predicate: '_return &lt; x or _return &lt; y')
  args for evaluation: x-&gt;3, y-&gt;5, _return-&gt;8</pre></b>
Notice the value of <b>_return</b> is listed with all the parameter values.
Of course, such strings are easier to read than what Python prints for 
  lambdas/functions.
<p>

</p></li><li>For <b>def f(x:'x&gt;0'):...</b> called as <b>f('a')</b>
  the exception message would be:
<b><pre>AssertionError: 'x' annotation check(str predicate: 'x&gt;0') raised exception
  exception = TypeError: unorderable types: str() &gt; int()</pre></b>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>Implement <b>__check_annotation__</b> for the <b>Bag</b> class.
<!--- or the class produced by calling <b>pnamedtuple</b>--->.
</li></ul>

<h3>A Largish Example: Full Output</h3>
When I put the following code in the script (before the driver) in the
  <b>checkannotation.py</b> module).
<b><pre>  @Check_Annotation
  def f(x:[[int]]): pass
    
  f([[1,2],[3,4],[5,'a']])</pre></b>
the result printed was the following , although I edited out some of the code
  that Python displays from my program: lines that start with ...
<b><pre>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    @Check_Annotation
    def f(x:[[int]]): pass
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to put the small tests show in this document (or in the <b>bsc.txt</b>
  file) in the same position (before the driver) to test the annotations as you
  write them.

<h3>Testing</h3>
The sections above present various tests for elements of the annotation
  language: they are easy to specify because the parameter annotations
  involve only the header: the body can be <b>pass</b>; when checking return
  annotations, we can put one return statement in the body of the code, to
  return a value that does/doesn't satisfy the annotation.
<p>
I provided an <b>if __name__ == '__main__':</b> section in the
  <b>checkannotation.py</b> module.
Again, it is easy to test a simple function there by annotating it and then
  calling it (described in the previous section).
</p><p>  
I provided code to call <b>driver.driver()</b> which can be used to run
  individual and <b>batch_self_check</b>, using the file <b>bsc.txt</b>.
</p><p>
Here is an example of running individual tests.
After importing and abbreviating the name of the <b>Check_Annotation</b>
  class it defines a simply annotated function, decorates it, and then calls
  the function with good and bad arguments (which in the latter case rasise
  an exception because of an annotation failure).
<b></b></p><pre><b>Command[!]: from checkannotation import Check_Annotation as ca
Command[from checkannotation import Check_Annotation as ca]: def f(x:int): pass
Command[def f(x:int): pass]: f = ca(f)
Command[f = ca(f)]: f(1)
Command[f(1)]: f('a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Pattis\workspace\courselib\driver.py", line 225, in driver
    exec(old,local,globl)

AssertionError: 'x' failed annotation check(wrong type): value = 'a'
  was type str ...should be type int
Command[f('a')]:</b></pre>

When runing <b>batch_self_check</b>, you might want to start by removing
  all but the earliest test (or comment them out with <b>#</b>) as you start
  testing your code).
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT for running batch-self-check:</b>
To use the <b>batch_self_check</b> you must remove the part of your
   <b>__call__</b> method that prints out the source lines when an assertion
   exception is raised: otherwise Python will raise a strange exception
   (<b>OSError</b>), which disrupts <b>batch_self_check</b>.
Comment out the following lines so that your code looks like
<b></b></p><pre><b>except AssertionError:
#     print(80*'-')
#     for l in inspect.getsourcelines(self._f)[0]: # ignore starting line #
#     print(l.rstrip())
#     print(80*'-')
    raise</b></pre>
