<td width="80%">
This programming assignment is designed to ensure that you know how to use
  combinations of Python's most important data types to model and
  compactly write code that solves a wide variety of different programming 
  problems.
The kind of abstract thinking that goes into modeling solutions to these
  programming problems with these data types (and iteration over them) is
  critical to your development as computer scientists.
<p>
There are five parts to this assignment (and and extra credit part at the end).
In each you will be asked to write a module that contains a few functions
  and a script at the bottom, which ties these functions together to solve
  the problem.
</p><p>
You should download the 
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Epattis/ICS-33/assignments/program1/program1.zip">program1</a> project folder and use it to create an
  Eclipse project.
You will create each modules in this project, and submit each module
  separately in Checkmate.
The project folder contains no modules, but it does contain all the data files
  you need to test/debug you modules.
</p><p>
You should work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in your lab section.
Try to find someone who lives near you, with similar programming skills,
  and work habits/schedule: e.g., talk about whether you prefer to work
  mornings, nights, or weekends; what kind of commitment you will make to submit
  program early.
If you believe that it is impossible for you to work with someone, because of
  some special reason(s), you should send me email stating them and asking for
  special permission to work alone (which I do grant, but not frequently).
</p><p>
<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
</p><pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
If you do not know what the terms <b>cooperatively</b> and/or
  <b>rules for pair programming</b> mean, please read about
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Epattis/common/handouts/pairprogramming.html">Pair Programming</a> 
  before starting this assignment.
Please turn in each program <b>as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately
  assess the progress of the class as a whole during this assignment.
<p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
The code you write should be as compact and elegant as possible, using 
  appropriate Python idioms.
You should familiarize yourselves with the <b>safe_open</b> function in the
  <b>goody</b> module and all the functions in the <b>prompt</b> module, both
  of which you should have installed in your <b>courselib</b> folder as part
  of the Eclipse/Python installation.
Recall how to use the <b>sep</b> and <b>end</b> parameters in the <b>print</b>
  function.
</p><p>
</p><p>
This assignment has 5 parts: pairs should work on each part together.
Parts 1-3 are going to be worth 14 points each; parts 4-5 are to be worth 9
  points each.
This skewing of points towards the simpler parts means students finishing the
  first 3 parts correctly will have a 70% average; those finishing the first 4 
  parts correctly will have an 85% average; but to get an A on this 
  assignment requires solving all parts correctly.
Remember I'm going to be running MOSS on the parts of this assignment.
</p><p>
Finally, reread the section on <b>Time Management</b> from Programming
  Assignment 0 before starting this assignment.

<td width="20%"><b>Problem #1: Reachability</b></td>
<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Write a script that prompts the user to enter the name of
  a file representing a graph.
</li><li>Read the information in the file, storing the graph in a dictionary.
</li><li>Print the graph.
</li><li>Repeatedly prompt the user for a starting node in the graph, and compute and
      print all the nodes that are reachable from it by following edges in the
      graph.
</li></ul>
<h3>Input and Output</h3>
Read a file of pairs of node names (representing edges) in a directed
  graph, building a <b>dict</b> whose key is a <b>str</b> source node and whose
  value is a <b>set</b> of <b>str</b> destination nodes that are each
  reachable from the source node key.
We write this informally as <b>dict[str] -&gt; set{str}</b>
<p>
Two nodes appear on each line: first the source node, then the destination
  node, with these node names separated by one semicolon character.
For example, the input file <b>graph1.txt</b> contains the following
  lines (which could appear in this order, or any other):
<b></b></p><pre><b>  c;f
  b;d
  a;c
  c;e
  d;g
  a;b
  e;d
  f;g
  f;d</b></pre>
which represent the graph
<p>
<img src="Program%201_files/graph.gif">
</p><p>
Print the graph, one source node per line (the source nodes are printed
  alphabetically) followed by the set of all the destination nodes that the
  source can immediately reach.
The graph above would print as
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Graph: source -&gt; {destination} edges
     a -&gt; {'c', 'b'}
     b -&gt; {'d'}
     c -&gt; {'f', 'e'}
     d -&gt; {'g'}
     e -&gt; {'d'}
     f -&gt; {'g', 'd'}</b></pre>
<p>
Note that the source nodes are <b>sorted</b> alphabetically, but the <b>set</b>
   of desintation nodes does <b>not have to be sorted</b>:
  in fact it makes no sense to talk about sorted <b>sets</b>; we could talk
  about a sorted <b>list</b> whose contents came from a <b>set</b>.
Note that because node <b>g</b> is not a source node (it is only a
  destination node), it does not appear first on any line (and appears only
  in the <b>sets</b> for source nodes <b>d</b> and <b>f</b>.
</p><p>
Note that there are multiple data files for this program: <b>graph1.txt</b>,
  <b>graph2.txt</b> and <b>graph3.txt</b>; test/debug your program on 
  the first file; when you are done, test it on the last two.
Draw the graph represented by each for to ensure that your code correctly
  prints it and computes the nodes reachable from any source node (which you
  can do by eyeballing the graphs: they are small).
</p><p>
Repeatedly prompt the user for a starting node in the graph (until <b>quit</b>
  is entered) and compute and print all the nodes that are reachable from it by
  following edges in the graph.
Reject any node not present in the graph.
An example interaction (processing the graph above) might be
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Enter starting node: e
  From e the reachable nodes are {'g', 'e', 'd'}

  Enter starting node: a
  From a the reachable nodes are {'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'}

  Enter starting node: quit</b></pre>
<h3>Functions and Script</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>read_graph</b> has an open (file) parameter; it returns the <b>dict</b>
     representing the graph
    (mine is 9 lines).
</li><li><b>print_graph</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the graph); it
    returns nothing, but it prints the graph in the appropriate form
     (mine is 4 lines).
</li><li><b>reachable</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the graph) and
    a <b>str</b> start node in the graph (technically a key in the <b>dict</b>;
    it returns a <b>set</b> of all the nodes reachable from it by following
    edges in the graph
   (mine is 9 lines).
</li><li>Write a script at the bottom of this module that calls these functions
   to solve the problem
   (mine is 7 lines).
<p>
I am supplying these number of lines not as requirements, but ballpark estimate
  of the amount of code you should write.
</p><p>
Here is the basic algorithm for computing reachability; it is simple to explain
  and not (very) complicated to implement.
But, you have to understand these instructions and carefully translate them into
  Python.
You should hand-simulate this algorithm using the graph above, and verify that
  it produces the results you expect before coding it.
You might be tempted to use recursion, but please don't: unless recursion is
  done very carefully, it will run forever on graphs with cycles: one of the
  input files is a graph with cycles.
</p><ol>
<li>To compute all the reachable nodes in a graph, create a <b>set</b>
   (initially empty) of reached nodes and a <b>list</b> (initially containing
   the  parameter start node) of nodes that we are going to explore (to find
   nodes they can reach).
<p>
</p></li><li>While the <b>exploring list</b> still has nodes, remove the first one
    (recall the <b>pop</b> method for lists) and put it into the
    <b>reached set</b>; for all its destination nodes that are not
   already in the <b>reached set</b>, put them in the <b>exploring list</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li>When the <b>exploring list</b> becomes empty (can you argue that this always
    will happen -there is no infinite looping), return the <b>reached set</b>.
</li></ol>
<p>
Print the set containing all these node labels.
When debugging this algorith, print the <b>set</b> and <b>list</b> after every
  interesting change, or use the debugger to see how these change.
</p></li></ul>
<h3>Sample Interaction</h3>
The program, as specified, will have the following interaction:
  user-typed information appears in <i>italics</i>.
Your output should "match" this one (sets will match if they have the same
  contents, independent of their order).
You should also check that it works for other starting nodes, and
  a variety of starting nodes in the other graphs.

<b><pre>  Enter file with graph: <i>graph1.txt</i>

  Graph: source -&gt; {destination} edges
    a -&gt; {'c', 'b'}
    b -&gt; {'d'}
    c -&gt; {'f', 'e'}
    d -&gt; {'g'}
    e -&gt; {'d'}
    f -&gt; {'g', 'd'}

  Enter starting node: <i>e</i>
  From e the reachable nodes are {'g', 'e', 'd'}

  Enter starting node: x

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Write a script that prompts the user to enter the name of
       a file representing the preference of a sequence of voters.
</li><li>Read the information in the file, storing it in a dictionary.
</li><li>Print the voter preference.
</li><li>Repeatedly display the vote count for ballots (sorted both by candidate
      and numerically), eliminating from the election the candidate receiving
      the fewest votes, until one candidate (the winner) or no candidates
      (a tie) remain.
</li></ul>
This form of election is known as <b>instant runoff voting</b>.
Every voter submits a ballot that ranks all the candidates the election, from
  from most favorite candidate to least favorite (we will use a <b>list</b>
  for this purpose: earlier in the list means more favored).
During the first ballot, votes are counted for each of the candidates according
  to the rankings of the voters.
Then the candidate(s) with the fewest number of votes are removed from the
  election: if more than one candidate receives the least number of votes, they
  all are removed from the election.
During the second ballot, votes are tallied for the <b>remaining candidates</b>
  (there are at least 1 fewer candidates); if a voter's first ranked candidate
  is not still in the  election, then his/her second ranked candidate should
  receive the vote; but if his/her second ranked cnadidate has been removed
  from the election, then his/her third ranked candidate should receive the
  vote ...).
This ballot process continues until either 1 candidate remains, or 0 candidates
  remain (meaning that all the remaining candidates tallied the same number
  of votes).
<h3>Input and Output</h3>
Read a file of voters and their ranking of the candidates, separated
  by semicolons, building a <b>dict</b> whose key is each voter and whose
  value is a list of candidates ranked by that voter (they appear in the
  file in order, from most favorite to least favorit)
We write this informally as <b>dict[str] -&gt; list[str]</b>.
<p>

For example, the input file <b>votepref1.txt</b> contains the following
  lines (which could appear in this order, or any other):
<b></b></p><pre><b>  A;X;Y;Z
  B;Y;Z;X
  C;Y;Z;X
  D;Z;Y;X
  E;Z;Y;X</b></pre>
The first line means, voter <b>A</b> ranks candidate <b>X</b> first,
  candidate <b>Y</b> second, and candidate <b>Z</b> third.
The second line means, voter <b>B</b> ranks candidate <b>Y</b> first,
  candidate <b>Z</b> second, and candidate <b>X</b> third.
Each line will have a unique voter and a permutation of all the 
  candidates running.
<p>
Print all the associations in this <b>dict</b>, one per line (the voters are
  printed alphabetically) using the following form.
Each line contains the voter and his/her complete ranking of the candidates.
For example, the file above would produce:
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Voter Preferences
     A  -&gt;  ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
     B  -&gt;  ['Y', 'Z', 'X']
     C  -&gt;  ['Y', 'Z', 'X']
     D  -&gt;  ['Z', 'Y', 'X']
     E  -&gt;  ['Z', 'Y', 'X']</b></pre>
<p>
Note that the voter names are <b>sorted</b> alphabetically, but the <b>list</b>
  of preference appear the same order they appeared in the file.
There are multiple data files for this program: <b>votepref1.txt</b>, 
  <b>votepref2.txt</b> and <b>votepref3.txt</b>; test/debug your program on the
  first file; when you are done, test it on the rest.
</p><p>
Start with all the candidates.
Evaluate the ballot to determine how many votes each candidate received.
Print this vote count two ways: sorted alphabetically and sorted numerically
  (in decreasing order).
Remove the candidate(s) receiving the fewest votes, and repeat this process
  until only one or no candidates remain.
Finally, print the outcome of the election: a single candidate winner or a tie.
An example interaction (processing the graph above) might be
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Vote count on ballot #1 with candidates (alphabetically) = {'X', 'Y', 'Z'}
    X  -&gt;  1
    Y  -&gt;  2
    Z  -&gt;  2

  Vote count on ballot #1 with candidates (numerical) = {'Y', 'X', 'Z'}
    Y  -&gt;  2
    Z  -&gt;  2
    X  -&gt;  1

  Vote count on ballot #2 with candidates (alphabetically) = {'Y', 'Z'}
    Y  -&gt;  3
    Z  -&gt;  2

  Vote count on ballot #2 with candidates (numerical) = {'Y', 'Z'}
    Y  -&gt;  3
    Z  -&gt;  2

  Winner is  {'Y'}</b></pre>
The first ballot consisted of all three candidates, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, 
  and <b>Z</b>.
For this ballot, the votes were counted and printed; candidate <b>X</b>
  received the fewest number of votes so is eliminated from the next ballot.
The second ballot consisted of two candidates, <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b>.
For this ballot, the votes were counted and printed; candidate <b>Z</b>
  received the fewest number of votes so is eliminated from the next ballot.
There is only one candidate remaining so <b>Y</b> is declared the winner.
An alternative outcome might be
<b>No winner: election is a tie among candidate remaining on the last ballot</b>
<h3>Functions and Script</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>print_dict</b> has a <b>str</b> title, any kind of <b>dict</b>, a
      <b>function</b>(default <b>None</b>) and <b>bool</b> (default
      <b>False</b>)as parameters and returns nothing; but it
      prints the title followed by the dictionary in the appropriate form and
      order (specified  by the function and <b>bool</b>).
    The function determines the ordering and the <b>bool</b> determines whether
      to reverse it: like the <b>key</b> and <b>reverse</b> parameters used to
      sort in Python.
    This function is used to print both the voter preference <b>dict</b> and
      the vote count <b>dict</b> for each ballot
     (mine is 4 lines).
</li><li><b>read_voter_preferences</b> has an open (file) parameter; it returns the
       <b>dict</b> representing each voter and his/her preferences: 
       <b>dict[str] -&gt; list[str]</b>
      (mine is 6 lines).
</li><li><b>evaluate_ballot</b> has a <b>dict</b> of voter preference 
         (<b>dict[str] -&gt; list[str]</b> read above) and a
         <b>set</b> of the remaining candidates as parameters; it returns
         a dictionary whose keys are these candidates and whose values are the
         number of votes they received on this ballot, based on the description
         of <b>instant runnoff voting</b>:
         <b>dict[str] -&gt; int</b>.
       Remember to count only one vote per voter, for his/her highest ranked
         candidate stil in the election
      (mine is 8 lines).
</li><li><b>remaining_candidates</b> has a <b>dict</b> as a parameter whose keys are
          candidates and whose values are the number of votes they received
          (<b>dict[str] -&gt; int</b>); it returns a set containing all those
          candidates remaining in the election (the one(s) receiving the
          fewest number of votes are absent).
       Note that if all the candidates receive the same number of votes, then
         this function returns an empty <b>set</b>.
       (mine is 3 lines).
</li><li>Write a script at the bottom of this module the calls these functions
   to solve the problem
   (mine is 13 lines).

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Write a script that prompts the user to enter the name of
       a file representing a finite automaton: indicating its <b>states</b> and
       input-&gt;state <b>transitions</b>.
</li><li>Read the information in the file, storing it in a dictionary.
</li><li>Print the finite automaton.
</li><li>Prompt the user for to enter the name of a file storing the start-state
      and inputs to process (each line in the file contains this combination).
</li><li>Repeatedly process these lines computing the results of the finite
      automaton on each input, and then display the results.
</li></ul>
A <b>finite  automaton</b> (FA) is an machine that is sometimes called
  Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA).
An FA is described by its <b>states</b> and its <b>transitions</b>:
  each <b>transition</b> for a <b>state</b> specifies an <b>input</b> and what
  <b>state</b> in the FA that input leads to.
We can illustrate a FA as a graph with labelled edges (see below).
<p>

</p><h3>Input and Output</h3>
Read a file that describes a FA: each line contains a state and an
  arbitrary number of input-&gt;state <b>transitions</b>.
Build a <b>dict</b> such that each keys is a <b>str</b> state and whose
   values is another <b>dict</b> specifying of the transitions from that state:
   this second <b>dict</b> has keys that are <b>str</b> inputs and 
   values are <b>str</b> states.
The first token on each line is the <b>str</b> state and the remaining tokens
  (always coming in pairs) are <b>str</b> inputs and states.
All tokens are separated by one semicolon character.
We write this informally as
  <b>dict[str] -&gt; (dict[str] -&gt; str)</b>.
<p>

For example, the input file <b>faparity.txt</b> contains the following lines
  (which could appear in this order, or any other):
<b></b></p><pre><b>  even;0;even;1;odd
  odd;0;odd;1;even</b></pre>
Here is a picture of the <b>parity</b> FA.
It graphically illustrates the two <b>states</b> (<b>even</b> and <b>odd</b>)
  and their <b>transitions</b>, using <b>inputs</b> (<b>0</b> and <b>1</b>)
  that always lead back to one of these two states.
<p>

<img src="Program%201_files/parity.jpg">
</p><p>

Here, the state <b>even</b> (meaning it has seen an even number of <b>1</b>
  inputs so far) is a key in the main <b>dict</b>.
It's value is a <b>dict</b> with two key/value pairs <b>0</b>/<b>even</b>
  and <b>1</b>/<b>odd</b>.
It means that in the <b>even</b> state, if the input is a <b>0</b> the
  FA stays in the <b>even</b> state; if the input is a <b>1</b> the
  FA goes to the <b>odd</b> state.
And similarly (the next line) means that for the <b>odd</b> state, if the input
  is a <b>0</b> the FA stays in the <b>odd</b> state; if the input is a
  <b>1</b> the FA goes back to the <b>even</b> state.
So, seeing an input of <b>0</b> keeps the FA in the same state;
  seeing an input of <b>1</b> flips the FA into the other state.
</p><p>

Print the finite automaton, one state (and its transitions) per line;
  the states are printed alphabetically and the transition <b>dict</b>
  for each state is printed as a list of input/state items (tuples) such that
  these are printed alphabetically by the inputs.
</p><p>
For example, the file above would produce:
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Finite Automaton Description
    even transitions: [('0', 'even'), ('1', 'odd')]
    odd transitions: [('0', 'odd'), ('1', 'even')]</b></pre>
<p>
Note that there are multiple data files for this program: <b>faparity.txt</b>
  and <b>fadivisibleby3.txt</b>; test/debug your program on 
  the first file; when you are done, test it on the last file.
Draw the FA represented by each for to ensure that your code correctly
  prints and computes with it.
</p><p>
Repeatedly process lines from a second input file, computing the results of the
  finite automaton for a start-state and its inputs; then print out all the
  results in a special form.
Each line in the file contains a start-state followed by a sequence of inputs.
The start-state will be a state in the FA (is a key in the outer <b>dictdict</b>).
</p><p>
For example, the input file <b>fainputparity.txt</b> contains the following
  three lines:
<b></b></p><pre><b>  even;1;0;1;1;0;1
  odd;1;0;1;1;0;1
  even;1;0;1;1;0;x</b></pre>
For example, the first line means, the start-state is <b>even</b> and the
  inputs are <b>1</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>0</b>, and <b>1</b>.
<p>
The result of processing each line is to print the start-state, and then each
  input and the new state it transitions to, and finally print the stop-state.
For the <b>parity</b> FA and the first line in this file, it should print
<b></b></p><pre><b>Start state = even
  input = 1; new state = odd
  input = 0; new state = odd
  input = 1; new state = even
  input = 1; new state = odd
  input = 0; new state = odd
  input = 1; new state = even
Stop state = even</b></pre>
<p>

</p><h3>Functions and Script</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>read_fa</b> has an open (file) parameter; it returns the <b>dict</b>

</li><li><b>print_fa</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the fa); it
    returns nothing,  but it prints the fa in the appropriate form

</li><li><b>process</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the fa),
    a <b>str</b> parameter (representing the start-state), and a <b>list</b>

    <b>list</b> that contains the start-state followed by <b>tuples</b> that
    show the input and resulting state after each transition.
    For the example shown above, <b>process</b> returns the following

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
<li> Write functions and a script that solve for a Non-Deterministic Finite
       Automaton the same problem that was solved for a Deterministic Finite
       Automaton in Problem #3 (above).
<p>
A non-deterministic finite automaton (NDFA) is machine described by its
  <b>states</b> and its <b>transitions</b>:
  each <b>transition</b> for a <b>state</b> specifies an <b>input</b> and what
  <b>state</b> (or <b>states</b>: that what makes it non-deterministic) that
  input leads to.
We can illustrate a NDFA as a graph with labelled edges (see below).
The critical difference is that a NDFA can have multiple edges with the same
  label going to different states (we'll see how to handle such transitions
  below).
</p><p>

</p><h3>Input and Output</h3>
Read a file that describes a NDFA: each line contains a state and an
  arbitrary number of input-&gt;state <b>transitions</b>.
Build a <b>dict</b> such that each keys is a <b>str</b> state and whose
   values is another <b>dict</b> specifying of the transitions from that state:
   this second <b>dict</b> has keys that are <b>str</b> inputs and 
   values are <b>sets</b> of <b>str</b> states: all the states a particular
   input can lead to.
The first token on each line is the <b>str</b> state and the remaining tokens
  (always coming in pairs) are <b>str</b> inputs and states.
All tokens are separated by one semicolon character.
We write this informally as
  <b>dict[str] -&gt; (dict[str] -&gt; set{str})</b>.
<p>

For example, the input file <b>ndfaendin01.txt</b> contains the following lines
  (which could appear in this order, or any other):
<b></b></p><pre><b>  start;0;start;1;start;0;near
  near;1;end
  end</b></pre>
Here is a picture of the <b>endin01</b> NDFA.
It graphically illustrates the three <b>states</b> (<b>start</b>, <b>near</b>,
  and <b>end</b>) and their <b>transitions</b>, using <b>inputs</b> (<b>0</b>
  and <b>1</b>).
<p>

<img src="Program%201_files/endin01.jpg">
</p><p>

Here, the state <b>start</b> is a key in the main <b>dict</b>.
It's value is a <b>dict</b> with two key/value pairs <b>0</b> mapping to the
  <b>set</b> containing <b>start</b> and <b>near</b> and <b>1</b> mapping to
  the <b>set</b> containing just <b>start</b>.
It means that in the <b>start</b> state, if the input is a <b>0</b> the
  NDFA can stay in the <b>start</b> state or it can go to the <b>near</b>
  state; if the input is a <b>1</b> the NSFA must stay in the <b>start</b>
  state.
And similarly the next line means that in the <b>near</b> state, if the
  input is a <b>1</b> the NDFA must go into the <b>end</b> state.
The last line means that the <b>end</b> state has no transitions out of it.
</p><p>

Print the ndfa, one state (and its transitions) per line;
  the states are printed alphabetically and the transition <b>dict</b>
  for each state is printed as a list of input/set of state items (tuples)
  such that these are printed alphabetically by the inputs.
Note that the state <b>end</b> is a key in the main <b>dict</b>, whose
  associated transitions are an empty <b>dict</b>
</p><p>

For example, the file above would produce:
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton
    end transitions: []
    near transitions: [('1', {'end'})]
    start transitions: [('0', {'near', 'start'}), ('1', {'start'})]</b></pre>
<p>
Note that there is only one pair of data files for this program.
</p><p>
Repeatedly process lines from a second input file, computing the results of the
  non-determinisitc finite automaton for a start-state and its inputs; then
  print out all the results in a special form.
Each line in the file contains a start-state followed by a sequence of inputs.
The start-state will be a state in the FA (is a key in the outer <b>dictdict</b>).
</p><p>
For example, the input file <b>ndfainputendin01.txt</b> contains the following
  two lines:
<b></b></p><pre><b>  start;1;0;1;1;0;1
  start;1;0;1;1;0;0</b></pre>
For example, the first line means, the start-state is <b>start</b> and the
  inputs <b>1</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>0</b>, and <b>1</b>.
<p>


The result of processing each line is to print the start-state, and then each
  input and the new states (plural) it could transition to (the <b>could</b>
  is what makes it non-deterministic), and finally print the stop-states.
For the <b>ndfaendin01</b> NDFA and the first line in this file, it should print
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Start state = start
    Input = 1; new possible states = {'start'}
    Input = 0; new possible states = {'near', 'start'}
    Input = 1; new possible states = {'end', 'start'}
    Input = 1; new possible states = {'start'}
    Input = 0; new possible states = {'near', 'start'}
    Input = 1; new possible states = {'end', 'start'}
  Stop state(s) = {'end', 'start'}</b></pre>
<p>

Note especially that in the <b>start</b> state, if the input is a <b>0</b>,
  then the NDFA can either remain in the <b>start</b> state or go into the
  <b>near</b> state.
For this program, we keep track of all states that the NDFA can be in,
  using a <b>set</b> of <b>new possible states</b>.
For the next input, <b>1</b>, we can be either in the <b>start</b> state
  (from the <b>start</b> state, an input of <b>1</b> allows us to stay in the
  <b>start</b> state) or the <b>end</b> state (from the <b>near</b> state, an
  input of <b>1</b> allows us to transition to the <b>end</b> state).
Thus, we keep track of the <b>set</b> of states the NDFA can be in, and the
  new <b>set</b> of states the NDFA can be in after processing the next input.
In this example, because <b>'end'</b> is included in the stop-states, this
  input does end in <b>01</b>.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Functions and Script</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>read_ndfa</b> has an open (file) parameter; it returns the <b>dict</b>
     representing the non-deterministic finite automaton; <b>hint</b>: I used
     splicing and the <b>zip</b> function to build the inner <b>dict</b>s, and
     I called the <b>setdefault</b> function for the inner <b>dict</b>
    (alternatively I could have built them as <b>defaultdict</b>s: see the
     standard  <b>collections</b> module)
    (mine is 9 lines).
</li><li><b>print_ndfa</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the ndfa); it

     (mine is 4 lines).
</li><li><b>process</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the ndfa),
    a <b>str</b> parameter (representing the start-state), and a <b>list</b>
    parameter (representing a list of <b>str</b> inputs); it returns a
    <b>list</b> that contains the start-state followed by <b>tuples</b> that
    show the input and resulting st of states after each transition.
    For the example shown above, <b>process</b> returns the following
    <b>list</b>.
<b><pre>  ['start', ('1', {'start'}), ('0', {'start', 'near'}), ('1', {'start', 'end'}), ('1', {'start'}),
    ('0', {'start', 'near'}), ('1', {'start', 'end'})]</pre></b>
    Finally, if an input is illegal (is not the key in some transition for the
    current state), just ignore it
   (mine is 11 lines; 7 using a double-comprehension).
    
</li><li><b>interpret</b> has a <b>list</b> parameter (the result produced by
    <b>process</b>; it returns nothing, but it prints the results of processing

The <b>ndfatrain.txt</b> file is a non-deterministic finite automaton
  that determines whether an train (sequence of characters representing
  different kinds of cars) is a legal train according to Chapter Exercise #7
  in the ENBF lecture.
Its input files are <b>ndfainput1train.txt</b> (which represents a legal train:
  end in the state <b>done</b>) and <b>ndfainput2train.txt</b> (which
  represents an illegal train).
</p><p>
The <b>ndfare.txt</b> file is a non-deterministic finite automaton translation
  of the regular expression <b>((a*|b)cd)+</b>. 
Its input files are <b>ndfainput1re.txt</b> (which matches: ends with

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Write a script that prompts the user to enter the <b>order statistic</b>
  (a positive number) and the name of a file of text.
</li><li>Read the file of text, storing a special <b>corpus</b> dictionary.
</li><li>Print the corpus dictionary.
</li><li>Prompt the user to enter the orderstatistic number of words, and the number
      of words to generate, then print a list of that many words randomly
      generated from the corpus.
</li></ul>
Your program will "learn" the word pattern of an author (based on some
  "order statistic" and reading a large sample of the author's writing) and
  then generate random text following the author's word patterns.
<p>
</p><h3>Input and Output</h3>
After prompting for the order statistic, read a file of words, building a
  <b>dict</b> storing data described as:
  <b>dict[tuple[str<sup>n</sup>]] -&gt; list[str]</b>.
Here the <b>dict</b>'s keys are <b>tuple</b>s of <b>n</b> words (<b>n</b>
  is the order statistic) and each key's value is a <b>list</b> of all the
  words in the text that follow these words:
  e.g., if <b>n</b> were <b>2</b>, the <b>dict</b> would contain a key for every
  pair of words appearing next to each other in the text, and a value that is a
  <b>list</b> of all the words following this key (no matter where the pair
  occurs, with NO DUPLICATES allowed in  the values list).
<p>
The easiest way to read the words one at a time is to use an iterator over the
  result returned by the function <b>goody.read_file_values</b>, which is
  passed an <b>open</b> object to read from.
Build the <b>dict</b> by "prereading" <b>n</b> words (by calling <b>next</b>) 
  into a list (assume that this is always possible; how might it not be?); then
  read the next word and put it in as a value associated with the <b>list</b> of
  pre-read words; then, drop the oldest word in the <b>list</b>, and add this
  next word to the end of the list (always keeping the list length at
  <b>n</b>); read the next word, and repeat the process for this word,
  continuing until there are no words to read.
You can use a normal for iterator over the values remaining.
Remember to convert this <b>list</b> to a <b>tuple</b> before using it as a key
  in the <b>dict</b>.
</p><p>
For a simple example, the file <b>wginput1.txt</b> contains the following
  lines (it could have all this information on one line or more lines):
<b></b></p><pre><b>  a b c b a d c b a d
  c a a b a a d</b></pre>
  
<p>
Print all the associations in the <b>dict</b>, one per line in standard lexical
  order; after printing all associations, print the length of the smallest and 
 largest <b>list</b> that is a value in the <b>dict</b>.
Each line contains an <b>n</b> word <b>tuple</b>, followed by the <b>list</b>
   of unique words that follow them in the text.
In standard lexical order, the keys appear in order relative to the first word 
  in the <b>tuple</b>; for all first words that are the same, they appear in
  order relative to the second word in the <b>tuple</b>; for all first and
  second words that are the same, they appear in order relative to the thrid
  word in the <b>tuple</b>; etc. (see the example below).
</p><p>
For example, the file above would produce:
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Corpus
    ('a', 'a') can be followed by any of ['b', 'd']
    ('a', 'b') can be followed by any of ['c', 'a']
    ('a', 'd') can be followed by any of ['c']
    ('b', 'a') can be followed by any of ['d', 'a']
    ('b', 'c') can be followed by any of ['b']
    ('c', 'a') can be followed by any of ['a']
    ('c', 'b') can be followed by any of ['a']
    ('d', 'c') can be followed by any of ['b', 'a']
  min/max = 1/2</b></pre>
<p>
For example, <b>('a','d')</b> appears three times in the text above, twice
  followed by <b>'c'</b> and once followed by nothing (at the end of the file);
  <b>('a','b')</b> appears twince in the file above, first followed by
  <b>'c'</b> and second followed by <b>'a'</b>.
</p><p>

Prompt the user for the words to start with (there are order statistic number
  of them) and the number of random words after that to generate.
Produce the list of words and print it. 
</p><p>
A random 10 word list, after the words <b>a</b> and <b>d</b> might
  print as
</p><pre><b>    Random text = ['a', 'd', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b']</b></pre>
In the result we start with <b>a d</b> (specified by the user), we
  know only <b>c</b> can come next; then using <b>d c</b> we know that
  either <b>b</b> or <b>a</b> must come next; it randomly chooses <b>a</b>...
<p>

</p><h3>Functions and Script</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>read_corpus</b> has an order statistic parameter and and open (file)
     parameter; it returns the <b>dict</b> representing the corpus of
     words in a file
    (mine is 9 lines).
</li><li><b>print_corpus</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the corpus);
     it returns nothing, but it prints the corpus in the appropriate form
     followed the min and max value <b>list</b> lengths
     (mine is 8 lines).
</li><li><b>produce text</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the corpus),
    a <b>list</b> parameter (representing the starting words), and an <b>int</b>
    count parameter (representing the number of additional words to generate);
    it returns a <b>list</b> that contains the the staring words followed by
    the generated words.
    <b>Hint</b>: use two lists (<b>list[str]</b>) both starting out with these
       starting words words.
    The first will always contain the current <b>n</b> words (to be coverted to
      a <b>tuple</b> and used as a key in the <b>dict</b>); the second will
      contain all the generated words.
    Generate a random next word from the <b>dict</b> using the <b>choice</b>
      function in the <b>random</b> modulesb: add it to both lists; then,
      drop the first word from the first list, so it remains a list of length
      <b>n</b>; repeat until you have generated the required number of words.
    <b>Warning</b>: you might have to stop prematurely if you generate the last
      <b>n</b> words in the text, and if these words occur nowhere else.
    That is because in this case, there is no random word to generate following
      them; in this case append a None to the end of the list of words and
      immediately return that list (mine is 11 lines).
    A slightly more elegant solution in Python uses only one list, copying the
       last order-statistic values of it into a tuple when needed for a key to
       the dictionary (e.g., l[-os:]; mine using this approach is 9 lines).

      to solve the problem.
