This programming assignment is designed to show how Python functions can define
  other Python code (in this case, a class) in an unexpected way: the function
  can build a huge string that represents the definition of a Python class and
  then call <b>exec</b> on it, which causes Python to define that class just as
  if it were written in a file and imported (in which case Python reads the
  file as a big string and does the same thing).
Your code will heavily rely on string formatting operations: I suggest using
  the <b>str.format</b> method to do the replacements: now is a good time to
  learn about this function if you don't know already know it; but you are free
  to use whatever string processing tool(s) you want.

<p>
I suggest that you first read the description below and define/test/debug as
  much of the <b>Point</b> class as you can, writing it directly in Eclipse
 (especially the<b>__getitem__</b>, <b>__eq__</b>, and <b>_replace__</b>
  methods).
You might want to write a small batch file to help you test this class.
</p><p>
Once you have written/debugged the code for the <b>Point</b> class, define the
  general <b>pnamedtuple</b> function, which when given the appropriate
  arguments (for the <b>Point</b> class: <b>pnamedtuple('Point', 'x y')</b>)
  constructs a huge string containing the same code as the <b>Point</b> class
  you wrote.
Much of the code from your <b>Point</b> class will be turned into strings and
  made generic: generalized for calls to <b>pnamedtuple</b> with different
  arguments.
Use the <b>.format</b> method to replace the generic parts with the actual
  strings needed for the class being defined.
</p><p>
Download the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Epattis/ICS-33/assignments/program3/program3.zip">program3</a> project folder and use it to
  create an Eclipse project.
Read and run the <b>miniexample.py</b> module, which performs a similar but
  simpler task: it illustrates how to write the <b>keep</b> function as a small
  string.
All the elements needed to write the <b>pnamedtuple</b> function appear in here
  in a simplfied form (see especially the call to the <b>join</b> function).
Put your <b>pnamedtuple</b> in the <b>pcollections.py</b> module, which can be
  tested in the standard driver or by writing code in the script at the bottom
  of the <b>pcollections.py</b> module.
</p><p>
It is recommend that you work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in your
  lab section.
Try to find someone who lives near you, with similar programming skills,
  and work habits/schedule: e.g., talk about whether you prefer to work
  mornings, nights, or weekends; what kind of commitment you will make to submit
  program early.
<!---
If you believe that it is impossible for you to work with someone, because of
  some special reason(s), you should send me email stating them and asking for
  special permission to work alone (which I do grant, but not frequently).
--->
</p><p>
<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
</p><pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
<p>
If you do not know what the terms <b>cooperatively</b> and/or
  <b>rules for pair programming</b> mean, please read about
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Epattis/common/handouts/pairprogramming.html">Pair Programming</a> 
  before starting this assignment.
</p><p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
The code you write should be as compact and elegant as possible, using 
  appropriate Python idioms.

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write a function named <b>pnamedtuple</b> that is passed information about a
  named tuple: it returns a reference to a class object from which we can
  construct instances of the specified named tuple.
We might use this class as follows:
<b><pre>from pcollections import pnamedtuple
Point = pnamedtuple('Point', 'x y')
p = Point(0,0)
...perform operations on p using methods defined in the Point class</pre></b>
Please note that although many of the examples in this description use the
  <b>Point</b> class, your <b>pnamedtuple</b> function must work for all legal
  calls.
For example the batch-self-check file uses descriptions (some legal, some
  not) of the <b>Triple</b> class.
<p>
I created six templates (one big, two medium, three small), which are each
  strings that have parts to fill in using the <b>format</b> method; all but
  the small strings are triple-quoted, multi-line strings, that look like large
  chunks of Python code (see <b>miniexample.py</b> in the download to help
  understand this paragraph, because it has similar templates).
</p><p>
Note calling the following <b>format</b> method on the string
<b></b></p><pre><b>'{name} from {country} tells you {rest}'.format(name='Rich',country='USA',rest='blah..blah..blah')</b></pre>
returns the string result
<b><pre>'Rich from USA tells you blah..blah..blah'</pre></b>
In many cases, the arguments I passed to the <b>format</b> calls were computed
  by list comprehensions turned into strings by calling the <b>.join</b> method
  (the opposite of the <b>.split</b> method).
See the <b>miniexample</b> for an example of everything working together to
  define a function by filling in a template with <b>.format</b>.
Finally, my solution is about 100 lines (including blank lines and comments,
  and a solution to the extra credit part), and that is divided between Python
  code (70% of the lines) and string templates that specify Python code (30% of
  the lines).
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define a function named <b>pnamedtuple</b> in a module named
    <b>pcollections.py</b> (that is the only name defined in the module, but
       this function can define local functions: I wrote three short ones).
    Its header is <b>def pnamedtuple(type_name, field_names, mutable=False):</b>
      an example call to this function is
       <b>Point = pnamedtuple('Point', ['x','y'], mutable=False)</b>, which
       is equivalent to writing <b>Point = pnamedtuple('Point', 'x y')</b> or
       <b>Point = pnamedtuple('Point', 'x,y')</b>.
    Using <b>Point</b>, we can then write code like <b>origin = Point(0,0)</b>.
    <p>
    A <b>legal name</b> for  the type and fields must start with a letter which
      can be followed by 0 or more letters, digits, or underscore characters
     (hint: I used a simple regular expression to verify legal names); also it
      must not be a Python keyword.
    Hint: the name <b>kwlist</b> is importable from the <b>keyword</b> module:
       it is bound to a list of all Python keywords.
    </p><p>
    The parameters must have the following structure.
    </p><ul>
       <li><b>type_name</b> must be a legal name (see above).
       <p>
       </p></li><li><b>field_names</b> must be a list of legal names (see above), or a
               string in which spaces separate legal names (or commas and
               optional spaces separate legal names).
           So, we can specify <b>field_names</b> like <b>['x','y']</b> or
	      <b>'x y'</b>, or  <b>'x,  y'</b>.
           If a name is duplicated, just ignore all but its first appearance
             (hint: I used the <b>unique</b> generator to filter out
             duplicates).
    </li></ul>
    <p>
    If any of the names are not legal, raise a <b>SyntaxError</b> with
      an appropriate message.
</p></li></ul>
The resulting class that is written should have the following functionality.
Note that the main job of <b>pnamedtuple</b> is to compute a large string
  that describes the class; we could define the class by writing the string to
  a file and then importing the file; instead, the <b>pnamedtuple</b> function
  returns the class object.
<ul>
  <li>Define the class name to be <b>type_name</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define an <b>__init__</b> method that has all the field names as parameters
      (in the order they appear in the second argument to <b>pnamedtuple</b>)
      and initializes every instance name (using these same names) with the
      value bound to its parameter.
    In addition, define the instance names <b>_fields</b> and <b>_mutable</b>,
       which are bound to a <b>list</b> of all the field names and the
       <b>bool</b> parameter respectively.
    For <b>Point</b> described above, the <b>__init__</b> method would be
<b><pre>    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self._fields = ['x','y']
        self._mutable = False</pre></b>
<p>
The problem here, and throughout the other parts of this is assignment is
  writing a functon like <b>gen_init</b> such that <b>gen_init(['x','y'])</b>
  produces the a string representing the <b>__init__</b> function above
  (including <b>\n</b> at the end of each line).
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Define the <b>__repr__</b> method that returns a string, which when passed
       to <b>eval</b> returns a newly constructed object that has all the same
       instance names and values(<b>==</b>) as the object <b>__repr__</b>
        was called on.
    For <b>Point</b>, if we defined <b>origin = Point(0,0)</b> then calling
       <b>repr(origin)</b> would return  <b>'Point(x=0,y=0)'</b>.
    Here is one way to write <b>__repr__</b> for <b>Point</b> using the
       <b>format</b> method,
<b><pre>    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Point(x={x},y={y})'.format(x=self.x,y=self.y)</pre></b>
       although there are other ways for it to produce the same resulting
       string.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define simple accessor methods for each of the field names.
    Each method name should start as <b>get_</b> followed by the name of
       a field.
    For <b>Point</b>, there would be two accessor methods.
<b><pre>    def get_x(self):
        return self.x
  
    def get_y(self):
        return self.y</pre></b>
    Note that with these methods, if we had a list of <b>Point</b> named
      <b>lp</b>, we could call <b>lp.sort(key= Point.get_x)</b> to sort the
      list by their <b>x</b> coordinates.
    Python's builtin <b>namedtuple</b> does not have this ability but the code
      it produces for retrieving these values runs a bit faster.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define the <b>__getitem__</b> method to overload the <b>[]</b> (indexing
       operator) for this class: an index of <b>0</b> returns the value of the
       first field name in the <b>field_names</b> list; an index of <b>1</b>
       returns the value of the second field name in the <b>field_names</b>
       list, etc.
    Also, the index can be a string with the named field.
    So, for <b>p = Point(1,2)</b> writing <b>p.get_x()</b>, or <b>p[0])</b>, 
      or <b>p['x']</b> returns a result of <b>1</b>.
    Raise an <b>IndexError</b> with an appropriate message if the index is out
       of bounds <b>int</b> or a string that does not name a field.
    <p>
    Note that this method can be used by Python to iterate through any class
       produced by <b>pnamedtuple</b> one index after another.
    It is also useful for writing the <b>__eq__</b> method: see below.
    </p><p>
    Hint: for an <b>int index</b> parameter, combine the <b>self._fields</b>,
      instance name, the <b>get_</b> methods, and the <b>eval</b> function
      to write a short solution to this problem; in the case of
      <b>origin = Point(0,0)</b>, calling <b>origin[1]</b> should construct 
      the  string <b>'self.get_y()'</b> and return <b>eval('self.get_y()')</b>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Overload the <b>==</b> operator so that it returns <b>True</b> when the two
      named tuples come from the same class and have all their name fields
      bound to equal values.
    Hint: use <b>__getitem__</b> for each name to check for equality.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>_replace</b> method, which takes <b>**kargs</b> as a parameter
      (keyword args).
    This allows the name <b>kargs</b> to be used in the method as a
       <b>dict</b> of  parameter names and their matching argument values.
    The semantics of the <b>_replace</b> method depends on the value stored in
      the instance name <b>self._mutable</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>If <b>True</b>, the instance namess of the object it is called on
           are changed and the method returns <b>None</b>.
        So, if <b>origin = Point(0,0)</b> and we call
        <b>origin._replace(y=5)</b>, then <b>print(origin)</b> would
           display as <b>Point(x=0,y=5)</b> because <b>origin</b> is mutated.
    <p>
    </p></li><li>If <b>False</b>, it returns a new object of the same class, whose
           instance name's values are the same, except for those specified
           in <b>kargs</b>.
        So, if <b>origin = Point(0,0)</b> and we call
        <b>new_origin = origin._replace(y=5)</b>, then
        <b>print(origin,new_origin)</b> would display as
        <b>Point(x=0,y=0) Point(x=0,y=5)</b> because <b>origin</b> is not
           mutated.
    </li></ul>
    <p>
    Define this method to look like
<b></b></p><pre><b>    def _replace(self,**kargs):
        if self._mutable:
            ...
        else:
            ...</b></pre>
    In both <b>...</b> we iterate (through <b>kargs.items()</b> or
      <b>self._fields</b>) and refer to <b>self.__dict__</b> to retrieve the
      current values bound to the instance names: this is a bit tricky.

    Use our textbook or web resources to learn more about <b>**kargs</b>; feel
      free to post specific question on the forum not relating to their actual
      use in <b>_replace</b> and also, not, "Could someone please explain
      **kargs to me").
    <p>
   The <b>kargexample.py</b> module has a little <b>**kargs</b> demo in it.
</p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Extra credit</b>:
    Define the <b>__setattr__</b> method so after <b>__init__</b> finishes, if
          the <b>mutable</b> parameter is <b>False</b>, the named tuple will not
          allow any instance names to be changed: it will raise an
          <b>AttributeError</b> with an appropriate message.
</li></ul>
<p>
Of course, our <b>pnamedtuple</b> function should work for <b>Point</b> as
  illustrated above, but should also work for any other legal call.
The actual <b>namedtuple</b> class in Python is implemented differently, but 
  this programming assignment requires you to use the implemenation above.


</p><h3>Testing</h3>
The <b>pcollections.py</b> module includes a script that calls
  <b>driver.driver()</b>.
The project folder contains a <b>bsc.txt</b> file (examine it) to use for
   batch-self-checking your function.
These are rigorous but not exhaustive tests.
<p>
Note that when exceptions are raised, they are printed by the driver but the 
  <b>Command:</b> prompt sometimes appears misplaced.
</p><p>
You can write othercode at the bottom of your <b>pcollections.py</b> module to
  test the <b>pnamedtuple</b> function, or type code into the driver as
  illustrated below.
Notice the default for each command is the command previously entered.
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Driver started
  Command[!]: from pcollections import pnamedtuple as pnt
  Command[from pcollections import pnamedtuple as pnt]: Point = pnt('Point', 'x y')
  Command[Point = pnt('Point', 'x y')]: origin = Point(0,0)
  Command[origin = Point(0,0)]: p1 = Point(5,2)
  Command[p1 = Point(5,2)]: print(p1)
  Point(x=5,y=2)
  Command[print(p1)]: print(p1.get_x())
  5
  Command[print(p1.get_x())]: print(p1[0])
  5
  Command[print(p1[0])]: print(p1['x'])
  5
  Command[print(p1['x'])]: print(p1['z'])
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:\Users\Pattis\workspace\courselib\driver.py", line 224, in driver

    File "<string>", line 17, in __getitem__

  Command[print(p1['z'])]: p2 = p1._replace(x=2,y=5)
  Command[p2 = p1._replace(x=2,y=5)]: print(p1,p2)
  Point(x=5,y=2) Point(x=2,y=5)
  Command[print(p1,p2)]: quit
  Driver stopped</string></module></string></b></pre>

<p>
Files for <b>batch_test</b> (see <b>bt.txt</b> for an example) just contain
  commands that will be executed; many are calls to the <b>print</b> function,
  which show the result of the print.
</p><p>
Remember that your <b>pnamedtuple</b> function can print on the console, for
  debugging purposes, the string it is about to <b>exec</b> so you can look for
  errors there (just eyeball whether the code correct).
The <b>show_listing</b> function (defined in the <b>pnamedtuple</b> function)
  display a string on the console, numbering its lines (useful when <b>exec</b> 
 finds an error: it reports a line number that <b>show_listing</b> shows).
</p><p>
Finalkly, I have also included two programs that David Kay published in ICS-31
  that use Python's <b>namedtuple</b> (with those names changed to
  <b>pnamedtuple</b>).
