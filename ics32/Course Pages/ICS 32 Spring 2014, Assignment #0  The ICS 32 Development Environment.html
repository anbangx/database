<p class="title">Introduction</p>

<p>It is very common in real-world software development jobs to be given, at the outset of a new job, a list of tools that you will be required to use.  Flexibility is great, and it's nice to be able to choose one's own toolset, but, unfortunately, many software tools introduce constraints on how a program can be written, how its components can be arranged, what functions can be called, what documentation can be written and how, what additional software it can be combined with, how it can be "built" to be distributed to end users, and so on.  So, like it or not, real-world software development usually requires at least some of the tools to be set in stone and used by all members of a team, even if not all members have the same preferences; this is simply a reality that software developers have to face.</p>

<p>Since we will be poking our heads into a fair number of darker "real-world" corners in this course, it becomes necessary for us to agree on the set of development tools that we'll use.  Not only will it be important to agree on the right tools, but it will be important to agree to use the right <i>versions</i> of those tools, as each differs in not-insignificant ways.  This assignment discusses those tools, provides instructions on how to install and configure them on your own machines, and how to use them either on your own machines or on the machines in the ICS labs.</p>

<p class="title">The ICS 32 development environment</p>

<p>The development environment for this course may seem quite familiar if you took ICS 31 recently.  As a standard, we will use the IDLE environment that is included with Python.  However, we will be using a particular version of Python (3.3.3) and certain configuration that was less important previously will become more important to us this quarter.  So rather than installing the tools yourself, I'd like each of you to follow these instructions, even if you think there is a better way to do it; this way, everyone is on an equal footing, and later needs you may not be aware of — when, for example, we start installing and using third-party libraries — will be met.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Avoiding newer versions of Python than 3.3.3</p>

<p>There is presently a 3.4.0 release of Python.  For your work this quarter, though, you should avoid this version and stick with 3.3.3, as this is the version available in the ICS labs and matches what we'll be using to grade your work.  (We like to stay with the latest when we can, but 3.4.0's release was too recent for the labs to be able to adapt in time.)  There are modifications and minor inconsistencies from one version of Python to the next — and 3.4.0, in particular, has additions and changes in its standard library that might affect your work this quarter — so it's possible that you might write a program that works one way on 3.4.0, but works differently when we grade it using 3.3.3.  The safest way to avoid this problem is to use the same version we'll be using for grading: 3.3.3.</p>

<p class="title">What do I do next?</p>

<p>If you will be doing your work solely using machines in the ICS labs, you're done!  The software you need is already installed and configured properly, so there's nothing you'll need to do for this assignment.</p>

<p>However, if you will be wanting to do at least some of your work on your own machine, what you do next depends on what operating system you're running on your machine.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics32/ProjectGuide/Assignment0/InstallWindows.html">Installing and Configuring the ICS 32 Development Environment on Windows</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics32/ProjectGuide/Assignment0/InstallMac.html">Installing and Configuring the ICS 32 Development Environment on Mac OS X</a></li>
  <li>(I expect that you'd be able to successfully use Linux in this course, as well, but the number of different distributions and competing mechanisms for installing, managing, and configuring software makes it impossible for me to provide a single set of comprehensive instructions, so you'll sadly be on your own; if you're a Linux user, however, you're probably accustomed to that!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you're done following the installation instructions for your chosen operating sytsem, you're ready to proceed with your work in this course!</p>
